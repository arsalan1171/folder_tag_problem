# folder_tag_problem

a java program to demonstrate how tags can be applied on folders and with some simple load balancing where if a specific tag is not available then a tag with the
maximum number of tags available is assigned to the folder.

this type of problem is often encountered in real world applications where we need to assign a client with an agent and therefore we assign an agent with most available
empty slots.
